Description: autopoint program from GNU gettext
 The `autopoint' program copies standard gettext infrastructure files
 into a source package.  It extracts from a macro call of the form
 `AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION(VERSION)', found in the package's
 `configure.in' or `configure.ac' file, the gettext version used by the
 package, and copies the infrastructure files belonging to this version
 into the package.
